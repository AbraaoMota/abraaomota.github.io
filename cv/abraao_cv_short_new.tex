	\section*{Work Experience}
	
		\textbf{Goldman Sachs - Asset Management Engineering - Executive Director}
		\\\textbf{July 2018 - Current} 
		\\ - Digitised 2 large-scale client onboarding workflows, resulting in operational \textbf{multi-HC savings}. I have also implemented an OCR solution to automatically hydrate workflows based on client submitted data, resulting in \textbf{100's of hours operational savings per year} as well as reducing double-keying risk.
		\\ - Designed \& implemented a system that tagged \& stored client uploaded documents with high uptime \& availability requirements - using a range of technologies including Kafka, Amazon S3 \& MongoDB.
		\\ - Have sought to coach \& encourage technical excellence within my team by instituting monthly calls to discuss topics of interest, where software craft \& new technologies are discussed. 
		\\ - Upgraded the infrastructure to a containerised solution for our flagship application using \textbf{Kubernetes}. This implementation created SSL certificates for all environments \& load-balances business critical traffic with \textbf{3 9's uptime}. This paved the way for containerisation of 3 further apps since.
		\\ - Led a 6 month integration with a vendor to overhaul the client servicing strategy for a product line. I co-ordinated a team of contractors to deliver on stakeholder requirements, while unblocking the project on technical risk buildout \& other compliance matters. Also implemented \textbf{migration strategy of 30k+ historical records} into the new system, which has handled \textbf{100k+ enquiries since go-live}. The system now captures customer analytics and has digitised phone enquiries via AWS Connect.
		\\ - Most recently have been leading a team of 8; developing \& executing a strategic roadmap to build out a new focused data pipeline, leveraging a Datalake \& load-balanced API's to serve fund data to various internal customers thousands of times a day. This strategy additionally aligns to the demise of several legacy systems by consolidating data sourcing into a single ownership model.
		\\ - Have used a variety of technologies in my tenure, including \textbf{Java, Python, Kubernetes, MongoDB, SybaseIQ, MemSQL, Kafka, SpringBoot, Angular, SQL, Graph Databases} to name a few.
		\\\\	
	\textbf{Unboxed - Software Developer}
		\\\textbf{April 2017 -â€“ September 2017} 
		\\ - Worked on a variety of Ruby on Rails projects, including security patches \& frontend updates to the UK Government Petitions website. 
		\\ - Created a simple CMS leveraging AWS S3 which hosted images for the internal company blog. 
		\\ - I contributed to the alpha \& beta stages of char.gy, an EV charging startup. This included enhancements in communication protocols to the charging point \& marketing email tracking enhancements to improve user nurturing journeys, as well as direct customer face-off.
		\\\\	
		\textbf{Alliants - Software Developer Intern}
		\\\textbf{July 2016 - September 2016}
		\\ - I created a tool using Ruby on Rails to store organisational information.
