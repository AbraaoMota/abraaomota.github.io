		\textbf{Highlights:}\\& 
		
		Thus far, I have developed my programming skills and become very confident with  \\&
		\textbf{Java} as a result, and familiar with \textbf{Haskell}, \textbf{C} and \textbf{Python}. Some of the modules I\\&
		have covered so far include \textbf{Logic, Hardware, Databases, Networks} and \\&
		\textbf{Software Engineering (Design \& Algorithms)}. \\& 
		I have also participated in many group projects; I helped to write a compiler in Java, \\& 
	 	parts of the \textit{PintOS} operating system, and most recently, \textit{Summit} (mentioned below).

	\begin{tabular}{ r |p{10cm}}
		
		\large{\textbf{Alliants}} & \textbf{Software Developer Intern}
		\\
		July 2016 || September 2016 & I worked on the \textit{Hub}, an internal tool designed to store organisational information for Alliants. It is built using Ruby on Rails, a framework I had no prior experience of. This really strengthened my Ruby and version control capabilities as part of a team, as well as teaching me about Test Driven Development.
		\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
		
		\large{\textbf{Self Employed}} & \textbf{Private Tutor}
		 \\		
		 October 2014 â€“|| June 2016 & I have taught 2 pupils for a year each, between 10 and 16 years of age. I firstly taught GCSE Mathematics, followed by Mathematics, Verbal and Non-verbal reasoning with the second pupil. I faced a great challenge as I dedicated a minimum of 4 hours per week to teaching whilst studying at university. It also taught me to communicate more efficiently by breaking down concepts into bite-size ideas for younger pupils.
